# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out reflection on the assignment.

## Question 1
#### In this assignment, we used your user input to construct a small website composed of flipping cards. Can you think of a more interesting use for this basic layout? The use you describe should serve some pedagogical or research-oriented purpose for historians or humanists

The layout of cards could be used as a very basic way to organise information in the early stages of sorting out personal interests for research. In my opinion, it could be a good way to narrow down ideas and figure out what a researcher is truly interested in. It can be used as a quick fact sheet or an overview, and displays key information in an organised fashion in which a researcher could easily compare and contrast different events or people as well. An example of this is if a researcher was interested in writing a paper on the impacts of a policy that former prime minister Pierre Trudeau had brought into Canada, but wasn’t sure which policies to prioritise or emphasise in their paper.

## Question 2
#### This assignment asks you all to perform a certian amount of work (describing yourselves) in order to improve a project (the course roster website). What responsibilities does the "researcher" (in this case, your teacher) have to the participants (you)? What rights do or should the participants have to the end product? 

One of the biggest responsibilities that the researcher has to the participants is making sure that either the information given by the participants stays confidential, or there is some form of consent that lets participants know that the information they give may be public. Continuing with the topic of privacy and consent, the participants must also have the rights to keep information private or make it public, and it is the researcher’s responsibility to respect the participants’ choices. Moreover, the researcher must make sure to give the option to private more sensitive information, such as email details or certain IDs. Although at times some information is compulsory, participants should be given the choice to keep some information that they don’t want to share with other people, private.

## Question 3
#### Information in each student record was provided as a series of "fields", that is, discrete units of information separated from each other. In the use you describe above, what fields would you need to provide for each record? Can you think of any limitations or obstacles that the use of this kind of data structure imposes on your project?

I would use at least six fields for each policy, including: 
- date enacted,
- length of time in which the policy was in place for,
- reasons for enacting policy (context to policy),
- impacts,
- the pros of the policy, and
- the cons of the policy

These six fields would provide a brief yet sufficient overview for each policy. The limitations of this data structure is that there are many other platforms that could be used to present this information as well. For example, Excel may be a more convenient platform to use to compare and contrast information because the facts can be viewed next to each other, and you wouldn’t have to scroll up and down to view the different cards. So although there aren’t necessarily obstacles that would disrupt the project, there are better platforms that could be used to display the information.
